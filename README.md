MSP430-Reaction-Game
====================

The object of the game is to stop the cycling LEDs at a specific LED to test your reaction skills. The TI MSP430G2231 microcontroller drives 8 LEDs via 3 pins using a 74HC595 shift register. The speed that the LEDs flash is determined from the potentiometer wiper via the analog to digital converter in the MSP430. There are also 2 pushbuttons to start/restart and stop the game. Everything is powered from a 9V battery that is dropped down to 3.3V via a LD1117V33 voltage regulator. There is also a programming header to program the microcontroller in-circuit with a TI Launchpad.
